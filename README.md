# Malicious URL Predictor/Detector
Here I am using Natural Language Processing techniques to predict whether a given URL is benign or malicious, using a dateset of around 4 lakh URLs from the Internet.
I have used TFIDF and Bag of Words(Count Vectorizer) to vectorize the text and used Multinomial Naive-Bayes and Logistic Regression as my machine learning models.
